# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The main purpose of the project is to organize, sort and analyze the data, to uncover the hidden trends from raw data using Excel. These trends can be helpful to retrieve useful insights and will provide the greater understanding of the data.

### Purpose
In this project, we were working on a Crowdfunding data to determine the specific factors that contribute towards the success of a campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The main purpose of analyzing outcomes based on launch date was to find out the best time of the year to start a similar campaign, which has a greater success rate in comparison with other months. Based on the count of the successful outcomes, campaigns under **theater** parent category were found to be most successful.
Following steps were followed for the analysis of theater outcomes based on launch date:

1. A **Years** column was created based on the **Date Created Conversion** column in the Kickstarter spreadsheet.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
